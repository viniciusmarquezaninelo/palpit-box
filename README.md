# palpit-box
My first project developed with the objective of learning in JavaScript, React, NextJS and TailwindCSS. 

The project is summarized in a website, where the customer enters to give his suggestion or criticism about the restaurant, that suggestion or criticism is stored in a google spreadsheet, and when giving his criticism or suggestion the customer wins a 10 discount coupon % to use in the restaurant.
